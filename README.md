# LivelyJS
A flexible JavaScript animation library for simple to complex animations.

## Features: 
* Can apply animations to JSON, Nodes and Node list by either supplying them directly or by passing in a string used in a query selector.
* Has linear, easeInQuad and easeInElastic* built in. More to come, however these are enough for testing out how animations look.
* Can use custom easing functions.
* Easy to install and use.

## TBD:
* Animated Key frames
* Specify easing functions per property affected (currently the same easing function affects all properties for a given target)


## Installing:
